# Horiseon Website Project
### An exercise in refactoring

This repository is a refactored codebase for the UCB Coding Bootcamp.

For this project, I've improved and commented the code for a fictional company's website.

The website is live on github pages [and can be viewed here.](https://studiomav.github.io/horiseon_website/Develop/#social-media-marketing)

If all is well, the page should display like in this screenshot:

There is no license for this project and it is intended for educational purposes only.
